- Due to the outbreak, we were unable to start school in time. The professional English class was also forced to go online. We have more than 200 students who study on the DingDing platform under the guidance of teacher Mrs.zeng. After a month of study, I have deepened my understanding and understanding of English.
- After so many years of English baptism, in the continuous exploration, looking for the best way to learn English, also achieved good results.My method is simple: make progress in reading. When you come across a new word, write it down, read it through, and then read it a few more times, until you get it right.Listening is a big weakness of mine. At present, I mainly learn through B station videos.(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1U7411a7xG)
- It can be said that English learning has been throughout our entire learning career.  Before the study, I have this question: our university is not to study  English, what is this professional English? Why study it? For most  students, there is doubt. 
- But these questions, in teacher Mrs.zeng in the first class, all disappeared. She said: English, as a widely used language in the field of computer and IT USES, has irreplaceable function, other language whether IT is learning the  latest computer technology, is using the latest computer software and  hardware products, can say is all in English to show, for the English  translation, often with a certain lag, and possible translation does not reach the designated position, mark, even the abrasive machine  translation is possible. So in order to avoid this situation, no longer subject to the language, the computer professional field of English learning, is very important.
- Once the teacher's words, solved the students confused and for a variety of professional materials in English version is also feel very  headache, or no Chinese translation, or a machine translation, reluctant to understand professional knowledge of students learning made a  tremendous obstacle to better learning, I have great expectation for  this course.
- In the class, teacher's humorous words made the online class  atmosphere especially active and relaxed. Through the continuous  deepening of the course, the unfamiliar words that I met at ordinary  times gradually became familiar with. The design of the text is also  close to the computer, computer architecture, computer language,  software development... And so on. When I was learning English, I also  got to know and understand all aspects of the computer, and my own  misunderstandings and questions about the computer were also answered. 
- As the main person in charge of the class, I had the opportunity to communicate with the teacher more. In this process, I felt the  responsibility and responsibility of the teacher. I could also see from  the teacher's signature that I was a teacher, and I kept in mind my  original intention and mission! In the live broadcast, the teacher's shy words are very approachable, which makes Ben feel more approachable due to the distance caused by online teaching.
- Was the teacher's classroom, teacher is not in a full chat, but interact with more than 200 people, this is my favorite place teacher said a  word, in a word, or a paragraph, will let you translate according to  what they have learned, you answer to Mr Screen by himself this way is  not only conducive to teachers get students' feedback timely, but also  arouse the enthusiasm of the students learning.
- Each class after class, the teacher will be homework for you, as a  consolidate classroom knowledge in the classroom to review and review  had a very good role at the same time, as a class, and I 闫慧 classmates  is responsible for the students homework to collect and present work,  the classmates to Miss.yan(闫慧), she after sent to me, I come to collect package  sent to the teacher, the students pay the word naming format is not  unified, I like obsessive-compulsive disorder will document word one by  one, into a student number + name format).
- No matter for the computer learning, or for the learning of English, is  endless, it can be said that the English ability is also a person's  computer ability is a foundation, can even be used to distinguish the  expert and the small white official documents tutorial, foreign platform video teaching, a large number of advanced technical books... Learned  English, the improvement of the computer, I believe, is only a matter of time.
- The course of professional English will soon come to an end. I would  like to thank the teacher for giving me the guidance on my study and the tolerance and understanding of my shortcomings.
